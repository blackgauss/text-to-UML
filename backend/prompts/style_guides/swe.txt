## Software Engineering Style Guide

Supplement to the general style guide. Apply these when the prompt describes
software systems, APIs, services, databases, or application architecture.

### Entities
- Distinguish between services (rectangles), databases/stores (cylinders or
  annotated rectangles), message queues (parallelogram or note), and external
  actors (stick figure/participant at edges).
- Name services by their role: AuthService, Gateway, OrderDB — not "Server 1".
- If a load balancer, cache, or proxy sits between caller and service, show it
  explicitly as its own node.

### Interactions
- Label arrows with the protocol or method where known (REST POST, gRPC, SQL
  query, pub/sub topic).
- Show request and response as separate arrows when the response carries
  meaningful data or status.
- Use dashed arrows for asynchronous / fire-and-forget messages (events, queue
  publishes). Use solid arrows for synchronous calls.

### Patterns
- For microservice architectures, group tightly coupled services in a subgraph
  labelled by bounded context or team ownership.
- For request-response flows, show the happy path end-to-end first; add alt
  blocks or branches only for error/retry paths that matter.
- For class diagrams, show inheritance with open arrows and composition with
  filled diamonds. Keep to the public interface; omit private helpers.

### Common mistakes to avoid
- Do not create a node for "JSON payload", "HTTP request", or any data object.
  These are edge labels.
- Do not draw bidirectional arrows when the interaction is clearly
  request → response (use two separate arrows instead).
